\title{Computing the decomposed spillover from a fevd as defined by Barunik, Krehlik (2015)}
\usage{
spilloverBK09(est, n.ahead = 100, no.corr, partition, table = F,
  absolute = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{est}{the estimate of a system, typically VAR estimate in our case}

\item{n.ahead}{how many periods ahead should the FEVD be computed, generally this number
should be high enough so that it won't change with additional period}

\item{no.corr}{boolean parameter whether the off-diagonal in the covariance matrix should be
set to zero}

\item{partition}{defines the frequency partitions to which the spillover should be decomposed}

\item{table}{boolean whether the full spillover table should be returned}

\item{absolute}{boolean defining whether to compute the within or absolute spillover}
}
\value{
A corresponding spillover value on a given freqeuncy band, ordering of bands corresponds to the ordering of original bounds.
}
\description{
This function is an internal implementation of the frequency spillover.
We apply the identification scheme suggested by fevd to the frequency
decomposition of the transfer functions from the estimate est.
